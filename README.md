# Python scripts

Various python scripts written for work.
Every script is provided 'as is'.

The folders are structured like: <Vendor>/<Product>
You will always find a folder nammend "common" with a class definition (the product interacted with)
and a example script. 

Pull requests and issues are welcome!
